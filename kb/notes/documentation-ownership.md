# Documentation ownership

Repository knowledge stays useful when each kind of truth has one primary home. The closest inherited `AGENTS.md` owns mandatory edit-time rules. `docs/` owns current multi-step procedures. Types, schemas, tests, and deterministic checkers own executable contracts. The KB owns pull-based rationale, evidence, maintained synthesis, relationships, and plans. `README.md` remains the human front door.

This authority direction is one-way. [[scopes/repository--cdb4ee2aea69|A scope hub]] can explain why a guide contains a constraint, but it cannot silently override that guide. A runbook can point to a test, but copying the test's rules into prose creates a second contract that can drift.

Use plans under `kb/plans/` to coordinate change and preserve decisions, deviations, review findings, and verification evidence. Promote a conclusion into a maintained note when it remains useful after the plan reaches a terminal state. The current operational summary belongs in [the documentation ownership runbook](../../docs/documentation.md).
